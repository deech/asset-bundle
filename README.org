* asset-bundle
  This library aims to solve the problem of bundling a Haskell executable with
  its [[https://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/developing-packages.html#pkg-field-data-files][assets]] *and* those in its dependencies by providing a couple of functions
  you can call from your project's ~Setup.hs~ so that doing `{cabal, stack}
  build` also creates a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)][zip]] of the executable and all of the assets it needs
  along with a launch script (a batch file on Windows and a shell script
  otherwise) that runs the executable adjusting various environment variables so
  that it can find them at runtime. Even if you're not deploying an executable
  directly to your users this package still makes it considerably simpler to
  dry-run on a test machine or in a Docker container.

* Documentation
  This library is extensively documented on [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/asset-bundle/docs/Distribution-Simple-AssetBundle.html][Hackage]], including [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/asset-bundle/docs/Distribution-Simple-AssetBundle.html#g:1][further motivation]]
